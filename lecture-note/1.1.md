## Chapter 1 Finite-Sample Properties of OLS

### Section 1 The Classical Linear Regression Model

...

#### Notes

- Assumption 1.1 (linearity) is a tautology. Only requires linearity.
- Assumption 1.1 linearity is not too restrictive, because any nonlinear function can be [linearized](../supplements/taylor-linearization.md).

#### Total Differential

See the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_of_a_function#Differentials_in_several_variables).

#### Differential vs. Elasticity

By the rules of differentiation

$$
\frac{d \ln x}{dx} = \frac{1}{x},
$$

we can write it in total differential form as

$$
d \ln x = \frac{dx}{x}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
d \ln y = \frac{dy}{y}.
$$

So

$$
\frac{d \ln y}{d \ln x} = \frac{d y / y}{d x / x}
$$

coincides with the definition of elasticity. It is of this reason that
in economics, variables are often expressed in logs rather than in
levels in equations.

#### Expectation

The (unconditional) expectation $\mathrm{E}(x)$ is defined as

$$
\mathrm{E}(x) = \int x f(y, x) \, dy dx
$$

#### Conditional Expectation

If $$(y, x)$$ are jointly distributed random variables, where their joint p.d.f. is expressed as $$f(y, x)$$, then $$\mathrm{E} (y | x)$$ is defined
as

$$
\mathrm{E} (y|x) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} y \frac{ f(y, x) }{ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(y, x) dy } dy,
$$

where $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(y, x) dy$$ is the definition of the marginal distribution of $$x$$. In words, the expectation of $$y$$ conditional on $$x$$ is the weighted average of $$y$$, where the weighting is the conditional probability density.

#### Law of Total Expectations

$$
\mathrm{E} ( \mathrm{E} (y | x) ) = \mathrm{E} (y).
$$

#### Law of Iterated Expectations

$$
\mathrm{E} ( \mathrm{E} (y | x, z) | z ) = \mathrm{E} (y | z).
$$

#### Moment

The $k$-th order moment of a random variable $x$ is defined as

$$
\mathrm{E}(x^k)
$$

#### Variance

$$
\mathrm{Var}(x) = \mathrm{E} [ (x - \mathrm{E} (x))^2 ]
$$

#### Covariance

$$
\mathrm{Cov} (x, y) = \mathrm{E} [ (x - \bar x )( y - \bar y) ] =
\mathrm{E} (xy) - \mathrm{E}(x) \mathrm{E} (y)
$$

#### Correlation Coefficient

$$
\rho_{x,y} = \frac{\mathrm{Cov} (x,y)}{\sqrt {\mathrm{Var} (x) \mathrm{Var} (y)}}
$$

#### Linearity of Expectation

$$
\mathrm{E} (ax + b) = a \mathrm{E} (x) + b
$$

#### Nonlinearity of Variance

$$
\mathrm{Var} (ax + b) = a^2 \mathrm{Var} (x).
$$
