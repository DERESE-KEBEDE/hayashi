#### Analytical Exercise 1.2 (The annihilator associated with the vector of ones)

Let $$ \mathbf{1} $$ be the $$n$$-dimensional column vector of ones, and let $$ \mathbf{M}_1 \equiv \mathbf{I}_n - \mathbf{1} ( \mathbf{1}' \mathbf{1} ) \mathbf{1}' $$. That is, $$ \mathbf{M}_1 $$ is the annihilator associated with $$ \mathbf{1} $$. Prove the following:

(a) $$ \mathbf{M}_1 $$ is symmetric and idempotent.

(b) $$ \mathbf{M}_1 \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0} $$.

(c) $$ \mathbf{M}_1 \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y} - \bar{y} \cdot \mathbf{1} $$ where

$$
\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i.
$$

$$ \mathbf{M}_1 \mathbf{y} $$ is the vector of **deviations from the mean**.
