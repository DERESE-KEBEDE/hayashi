#### Review Question 2.2.4

Let $$ \{ x_i \} $$ be a sequence of real numbers that change with $$i$$ and $$ \{ \varepsilon_i \} $$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with mean 0 and finite variance. Is $$ \{ x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i \} $$ i.i.d.? [Answer: No.] Is it serially independent? [Answer: Yes.] An m.d.s? [Answer: Yes.] Stationary? [Answer: No.]

##### Solution

(a) i.i.d.? No. Because $$ \operatorname*{Var} (x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i) = x_i^2 \sigma^2 $$ changes with $$i$$.

(b) Serially independent? Yes. Because $$ x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i $$ can be considered as a function of $$ \varepsilon_i $$, $$ f_i (\varepsilon_i) = x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i $$, and the functions of two independent random variables are also independent.

(c) m.d.s.? Yes. Let $$ z_i = x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i $$, $$ \operatorname*{E} ( z_i | z_{i-1}, z_{i-2}, \ldots, z_{1} ) = \operatorname*{E} ( z_i ) = x_i \operatorname*{E} ( \varepsilon_i ) = 0 $$.

(d) Stationary? No. Because $$ \operatorname*{Var} (x_i \cdot \varepsilon_i) = x_i^2 \sigma^2 $$ changes with $$i$$.
