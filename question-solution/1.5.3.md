#### Review Question 1.5.3 (Concentrated log likelihood with respect to $$ \tilde{ \sigma }^2 $$)

Writing $$ \tilde{ \sigma }^2 $$ as $$ \tilde{ \gamma } $$, the log likelihood function for the classical regression model is

$$
\log L ( \tilde{ \boldsymbol{ \beta } }, \tilde{ \gamma } ) =
- \frac{n}{2} \log ( 2 \pi ) -
\frac{n}{2} \log ( \tilde{ \gamma } ) -
\frac{1}{ 2 \tilde{ \gamma } }
( \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \tilde{ \boldsymbol{ \beta } } )'
( \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \tilde{ \boldsymbol{ \beta } } ).
$$

In the two-step maximization procedure described in the text, we first maximized this function with respect to $$ \tilde{ \boldsymbol{ \beta } } $$. Instead, first maximize with respect to $$ \tilde{ \gamma } $$ given $$ \tilde{ \boldsymbol{ \beta } } $$. Show that

##### Solution
