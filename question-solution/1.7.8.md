#### Review Question 1.7.8

Taking logs of both sides of the production function (1.7.1), one can derive the log-linear relationship

$$
\log ( Q_i ) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \log ( x_{i1} ) +
\alpha_2 \log ( x_{i2} ) + \alpha_3 \log ( x_{i3} ) +
\varepsilon_i,
\tag{1}
$$

where

$$
\alpha_0 \equiv \mathrm{E} [ \log ( A_i ) ],
\qquad
\varepsilon_i \equiv \log ( A_i ) - \mathrm{E} [ \log ( A_i ) ].
$$

Suppose, in addition to total costs, output, and factor prices, we had data on factor inputs. (a) Can we estimate $$ \alpha $$'s by applying OLS to this log-linear relationship? Why or why not? (b) Suggest a different way to estimate $$\alpha$$'s.

##### Solution

(a) The economic interpretation of the error term $$ \varepsilon_i $$ represents the firm's production efficiency relative to the industry's average efficiency. The input choice of the firm $$ ( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, x_{i3} ) $$ can depend on $$ \varepsilon_i $$, making regressors not be orthogonal to the error term. Applying OLS to log-linear relationship (1) will result in biased estimator, so we cannot estimate $$\alpha$$'s using OLS.

(b) Following microeconomic theory, under the Cobb-Douglas technology, input shares do not depend on factor prices.
